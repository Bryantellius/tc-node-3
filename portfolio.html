        <em>ESL teacher/Curriculum Coordinator</em>
              <ul>
                <li>Taught English as a Second Language classes to adult students from a
        variety of countries</li>
                <li>Was involved in a project to convert our record system from paper to
        electronic. This involved serving as the exclusive technical contact and
        system administrator, setting the system up to meet our needs, liaising
        with the vendor to resolve problems, and training staff on the new
        system.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>March–September 2013</strong>: Mountain Light Institute (Hwasun County, South
        Jeolla Province, South Korea)<br />
        <em>Volunteer</em>
              <ul>
                <li>Developed a bilingual website for the school with the constraint that, due
        to the remote location of the school, all development had to be done
        without internet access. Thus, there was no possibility of using any
        frameworks or documentation that was not already installed on my
        development machine. Despite this constraint, I was able to resolve all
        issues that cropped up and successfully launch the website.</li>
                <li>Helped with planning for all aspects of the then unopened school</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>2009–2013</strong>: SDA Samyook Language Institute (South Korea)<br />
        <em>Coordinator (head foreign teacher), Gwangju Branch</em>
              <ul>
                <li>Technical accomplishments
                  <ul>
                    <li>Developed a set of scheduling tools to make it easier to manage
        complex and sometimes conflicting schedules, requirements, and
        schedule requests. This tool saved me considerable time and helped me
        to avoid making errors that would otherwise have cost other employees
        money.</li>
                    <li>Developed documentation for our internal recordkeeping system in a format the
        teachers could easily use and understand, and was asked to present it
        to all coordinators company-wide. Because of this, the teachers were
          able to effectively use a wider range of the available features.</li>
                  </ul>

        Alvarado, TX)<br />
        <em>Pastor</em>
              <ul>
                <li>Developed an access-logging system for a youth event in PHP and
        CodeIgniter. This system created photo ID badges for all attendees and
        staff, who would scan their badges’ barcodes on entry and exit, thus
        creating a log of who was present when. In addition, the system was
        capable of flagging children who were not permitted to leave without being
        picked up by a parent. Many people commented that this system
        significantly increased the perceived level of professionalism for the
        event.</li>
